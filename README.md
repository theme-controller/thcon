## How it's Pronounced
It sounds like "thicken", and rhymes with "chicken", "quicken", and "stricken".

## Naming
`thcon` is short for "THeme CONtroller", pronounced like [the English word "thicken"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thicken).  The name was chosen from a misunderstanding of [pkcon](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/pkcon.1.html) as "PacKage CONtroller", and was maintained despite `pkcon` actually being a "PackageKit CONsole client".

Feel free to pretend this less embarrassing explanation is the truth:

> `thcon` (pronounced like [the English word "thicken"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thicken)) comes from the use of a [roux to thicken a sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux) while cooking, and is a play on the fact that a roux can cooked to either a light or dark color.  A roux thickens your sauce and can be light or dark; `thcon` makes your apps light or dark.  Perhaps it should have been called `roux`.

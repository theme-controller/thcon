<h1 id="index__title">thcon, A Configurable Theme Controller</h1>

Sometimes it's bright. Sometimes it's not. \
Sometimes your eyes just need a break.

`thcon` switches all your apps between dark and light themes with one command.

## What it Is
A small, configuration-driven command-line tool that switches themes in many
apps. You make your apps look the way you want in dark mode and in light mode,
then list those theme names in a `thcon.toml` file. Running `thcon dark`
switches them all to dark mode, and `thcon light` brings them all back to light
mode.

## What it Isn't
`thcon` doesn't generate themes, and it doesn't install them for you. Whether
you use default themes in each app, [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/)
everywhere, or a different combination of color schemes in each app, `thcon`
coordinates switching each app between your preferred dark and light themes,
whatever they are.

## How it's Pronounced
It sounds like "thicken", and rhymes with "chicken", "quicken", and "stricken".
